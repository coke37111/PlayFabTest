# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

## Development Commands

### Opening the Project
Open the `Client` folder in Unity Hub or Unity Editor. The project uses Unity 6000.1.5f1.

### Building the Project
Use Unity Editor's Build Settings (File > Build Settings) to build for target platforms.

### Input System
The project uses the new Unity Input System. Input actions are defined in `Assets/InputSystem_Actions.inputactions`.

## Architecture Notes

### Render Pipeline Configuration
- The project has separate URP renderer and pipeline assets for Mobile and PC targets
- Mobile settings: `Assets/Settings/Mobile_RPAsset.asset` and `Mobile_Renderer.asset`
- PC settings: `Assets/Settings/PC_RPAsset.asset` and `PC_Renderer.asset`
- Global URP settings: `Assets/Settings/UniversalRenderPipelineGlobalSettings.asset`

### Scene Setup
- Main scene: `Assets/Scenes/Main.unity`
- Scene builds are configured in `ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset`

### Company and Product Info
- Company: DefaultCompany
- Product Name: PlayFabTest

## PlayFab Integration

### Authentication System
The project implements a comprehensive authentication system in `Assets/Scripts/PlayFabLogin.cs`:

- **Editor Mode**: Uses CustomID login with fixed ID "GettingStartedGuide"
- **Build Mode (Android)**: Uses Android Device ID for automatic login
- **Google Login**: Async method `LoginWithGoogleAsync()` with fallback to guest login
- **Guest Login**: Async method `LoginAsGuestAsync()` using device unique identifier
- **Firebase Integration**: Includes `SyncFirebaseUserIdOnAccountLink()` method for syncing Firebase UserID with PlayFab (implementation in progress)

### PlayFab Configuration
- **TitleId Setup**: Must be configured in PlayFabSettings (accessed via Unity menu: Window > PlayFab > Editor Extensions)
- **API Modules Available**: Client, Server, Admin, Authentication, Economy, Events, Groups, Matchmaker, Multiplayer, Profiles, and more
- **Editor Extensions**: Use Window > PlayFab menu in Unity Editor for configuration and SDK management

### Key PlayFab Features in Use
- Account creation on first login
- Player profile information retrieval
- Social authentication (Google) with guest fallback
- Cross-platform login (CustomID for testing, DeviceID for production)

## Firebase Integration

### Current Setup
Firebase Unity SDK 13.3.0 is installed with the following modules:
- **firebase-app-unity**: Core Firebase functionality
- **firebase-auth-unity**: Authentication services
- **firebase-analytics**: Analytics and event tracking
- **firebase-common**: Common Firebase utilities

Firebase dependencies are managed through External Dependency Manager (EDM4U) and configured in:
- `Assets/Plugins/Android/mainTemplate.gradle` - Android Gradle dependencies
- Firebase configuration files should be placed in appropriate platform directories

### Architecture Overview
The project is designed to use Firebase and PlayFab together with the following architecture:

1. **Firebase Guest Authentication**: User starts with Firebase Anonymous/Guest login
2. **Social Login Upgrade**: User upgrades to Google/Apple login through social providers
3. **PlayFab Account Linking**: Social login credentials are used to authenticate with PlayFab
4. **Firebase UserID Sync**: Firebase UserID is stored in PlayFab's user data for cross-reference

### Account Linking Flow
```
Firebase Guest ID ‚Üí Social Login (Google) ‚Üí PlayFab Authentication ‚Üí Store Firebase UserID in PlayFab
```

### Key Components
- ‚úÖ Firebase Authentication SDK (installed)
- ‚úÖ Firebase Analytics SDK (installed)
- üîÑ Firebase UserID storage in PlayFab's PlayerData (in progress in PlayFabLogin.cs)
- ‚è≥ Social authentication providers (Google Play Games, Apple Sign-In) - to be implemented
- ‚è≥ Account recovery mechanism using Firebase UserID - to be implemented
- ‚è≥ Progress synchronization between Firebase and PlayFab - to be implemented

### Firebase Configuration Files
Required configuration files (must be added to the project):
- **Android**: `google-services.json` ‚Üí place in `Assets/StreamingAssets/` or `Assets/Plugins/Android/`
- **iOS**: `GoogleService-Info.plist` ‚Üí place in `Assets/Plugins/iOS/`

### Benefits of This Architecture
- **Firebase**: Handles guest sessions and provides Firebase-specific services (Analytics, Remote Config, etc.)
- **PlayFab**: Manages player data, economy, leaderboards, and cross-platform progression
- **Social Login**: Provides seamless account upgrade path from guest to persistent account
- **UserID Sync**: Enables account recovery and cross-service data consistency

## Working with Unity Projects

- Unity generates code in .csproj files (Assembly-CSharp.csproj, Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj)
- The Library/ folder contains Unity's build cache and should not be modified directly
- All custom scripts should be placed in appropriate subdirectories under Assets/
- Editor scripts must be in an "Editor" folder to be excluded from builds

## Development Workflow

### Testing PlayFab Features
1. Configure PlayFab TitleId via Window > PlayFab > Editor Extensions
2. In Editor: Uses CustomID authentication automatically
3. On Device: Uses Android Device ID for persistent authentication
4. Check Unity Console for login success/failure messages

### Adding New PlayFab Features
- PlayFab APIs are available through `PlayFabClientAPI`, `PlayFabServerAPI`, etc.
- Use callback pattern or async/await with TaskCompletionSource (as shown in PlayFabLogin.cs)
- All API requests require prior authentication (login)
- Error handling via `PlayFabError.GenerateErrorReport()`

### Implementing Firebase Integration
1. ‚úÖ Firebase Unity SDK 13.3.0 is already installed
2. ‚è≥ Configure `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)
3. ‚è≥ Implement Firebase Anonymous Authentication for guest sessions
4. ‚è≥ Store Firebase UserID in PlayFab using `UpdateUserData` API
5. ‚è≥ Retrieve Firebase UserID from PlayFab using `GetUserData` API for account recovery

### Social Login Integration Strategy
- Use social provider tokens (Google, Apple) to authenticate with both Firebase and PlayFab
- Firebase: `FirebaseAuth.SignInWithCredential()`
- PlayFab: `LoginWithGoogleAccount()` or `LoginWithApple()` (already implemented in PlayFabLogin.cs)
- After successful authentication on both platforms, sync user identifiers between services

### Android Build Configuration
The project uses custom Gradle templates with Firebase dependencies:
- **mainTemplate.gradle**: Contains Firebase SDK dependencies (firebase-auth:24.0.1, firebase-analytics:23.0.0, etc.)
- **settingsTemplate.gradle**: Custom Gradle settings
- **Keystore**: Located at `C:/Projects/PlayFabTest/Keystore/MochiRollRoll.keystore`
- **Compile SDK**: 36 (Android 14+)
- **Target SDK**: As configured in ProjectSettings

### Troubleshooting Build Issues
If Gradle build fails with network errors (unable to download Firebase dependencies):
1. Check internet connection and ensure access to dl.google.com and repo.maven.apache.org
2. Try using a VPN if network is restricted
3. Configure Gradle to use a different mirror repository if needed
4. Clean build: Delete `Library/Bee/Android` folder and rebuild
5. Update Firebase SDK versions in `mainTemplate.gradle` if compatibility issues occur
